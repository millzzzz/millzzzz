### Ahoj,

I'm currently working on all things modern web development, sophisticated fast FEND experiences focused on storytelling and audio-visual aesthetics.

ðŸŒ±My public list of topics I'm passionate about in 2025:

- Typescript and related distributed graphics and real-time technologies like WebAssembly/WebGPU/WebGL/Web Socket
- Common Lisp and its applicatins in music projects like Open Music, related Sonic Pi, Supercollider, etc.
- Haskell/Elixir functional prommming languages paradigm
- Rhino/Grasshopper workflow enhancement and plugin development
- Local-first AI/ML multi-modal fine-tuned computer vision model training using kinematic motion data and its potential in movement-based art forms like breaking ðŸª©
- LLM model training, RAG, niche synthetic GraphRAG experimental techniques
- 3D graphics computing and rendering in Unreal Engine, Keyshot, Cinema 4D
- Three.js storytelling + animation libraries Theatre.js, Drei, react-spring, GSAP, etc
- AutoCAD/Solidworks, Revit, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe After Effects
- functional programming in Haskell/Elixir
- low-level embedded programming in Rust/Gleam/Zig
- miscellaneous: Bun.js, Prismic, Redis, GraphQl, Payload CMS, Supabase, PostgresSQL

little bit more effort: Adobe Animate, OpenToonz, ProCreate Dreams
brush up: Figma

BUT I'm most excited about Lua's embeddable potential + Phoenix LiveView as of this moment!
